special cases
1. the same header with several different bodies
work well
2. circle rules: p->q && q->p
runtime error
3. the header is conbined in the bodies: p ^ q -> p
runtime error
4. input multiple goals
work well
5. duplicate rules

limitation:
1. can only solve queries conjuncted with AND
2. can only accept rules conjuncted with AND

improvement:
1. store reasoned subgoal as new rules to reduce redundent reasoning

key point:
all goals are conjuncted and have to be achieved simutanously. 

attention:
delete subgoals that contain header cannot be made
